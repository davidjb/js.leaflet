js.leaflet
***********

Introduction
============

This library packages the `Leaflet`_ JavaScript mapping library for
`fanstatic`_.

.. _`fanstatic`: http://fanstatic.org
.. _`Leaflet`: http://leafletjs.com/

This requires integration between your web framework and ``fanstatic``,
and making sure that the original resources (shipped in the ``resources``
directory in ``js.leaflet``) are published to some URL.  As a bonus, this
library also packages up minified versions of the original CSS resources.

Packaging
=========

The packaging is stored on GitHub at
https://github.com/davidjb/js.leaflet. If you happen to come across a bug
that corresponds to *packaging*, then please report it here. Pull requests are
more than welcome if you're fixing something yourself -- the more help the
better!

Any other bugs that relate to the library itself should be directed to the
original developers.
